# Squads Public Client v4

This repository hosts the code for a simplified client application for the Squads V4 Program. The app can be built, verified for integrity, and deployed as a static site using multiple hosting options, including self-hostable solutions like Docker with Nginx. Hereâ€™s how you can use it effectively.

---

## Features

- **Verifiable Build**: The `dist/` directory contains the static files that can be verified via a hash. This ensures the integrity of the build delivered.
  - Verification can be done against:
    - **Remote URLs**: Downloaded files can be verified for consistency with the expected hash.
    - **IPFS CID**: Retrieve the build from IPFS and verify its authenticity.
- **Self-hosting**: Run the application as a Docker container using an Nginx server for fully self-managed hosting.

---

## Getting Started

The following steps will guide you to build, verify, and host the application.

### 1. **Build the Web App**

#### Prerequisites:

- [Node.js v20+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

#### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/x1-labs/squads-v4-client
   cd squads-v4-client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

3. Configure environment variables (optional):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` to customize the following variables:
   - `APP_RPC_URL`: Solana RPC endpoint (default: `https://rpc.testnet.x1.xyz`)
   - `APP_PROGRAM_ID`: Squads program ID (default: `DDL3Xp6ie85DXgiPkXJ7abUyS2tGv4CGEod2DeQXQ941`)
   - `APP_EXPLORER_URL`: Solana explorer URL (default: `https://explorer.x1.com`)
   - `APP_SAVED_SQUAD_*`: Pre-configured saved squads (see .env.example for format)

   Note: These values can also be configured at runtime through the app's settings page.

4. Build the application:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   A `dist/` directory will be created containing the static files.

5. Generate a hash of the build:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-hash.sh
   ```

---

### 2. **Verify the Build**

#### Verifying Against a Remote URL

To verify the files hosted at a remote URL:

1. Use the `scripts/verify-remote.sh` script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify-remote.sh <REMOTE_URL> <EXPECTED_HASH>
   ```
   Replace `<REMOTE_URL>` with the base URL of the remote site and `<EXPECTED_HASH>` with the known SHA-256 hash of the build.

---

#### Verifying Against an IPFS CID

To verify an IPFS-hosted build:

1. Ensure you have the IPFS CLI installed (`ipfs`).
2. Use the `scripts/verify-ipfs.sh` script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify-ipfs.sh <IPFS_CID> <EXPECTED_HASH>
   ```
   Replace `<IPFS_CID>` with the CID of the IPFS build and `<EXPECTED_HASH>` with the known SHA-256 hash.

---

### 3. **Self-Host with Docker**

#### Prerequisites:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

#### Run the Docker Container

You can deploy the web app via a self-hosted Docker container using Nginx:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t squads-public-v4-client .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 squads-public-v4-client
   ```

The app will now be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. Retrieve the hash from the running container:
   ```bash
   docker exec <container_id> cat /var/build-metadata/hash.txt
   ```

---

### 4. **Build Hash**

A SHA-256 build hash is generated by combining all files in the `dist/` directory in a deterministic order.

#### To Check or Compute the Build Hash Locally:

1. Run the `scripts/generate-hash.sh` script:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-hash.sh
   ```

   The output will show the computed hash of the local `dist/` content. This hash should match the one provided in the deployment.

---

## File Integrity During Deployment

### Manifest File

A `manifest.json` file is included in the build, containing references to all static assets. It ensures that asset file mappings remain consistent during deployment.

## Program Registry

The application includes a central registry system for X1 programs that manages IDLs, instruction summaries, and transaction tags. This allows for better transaction decoding and user-friendly display of on-chain data.

### Adding a New Program

To add support for a new X1 program, edit the `src/registry.ts` file and add your program registration:

```typescript
registry.register({
  programId: 'YourProgramId123...', // Your program's public key
  name: 'Your Program Name', // Human-readable name
  idl: yourIdl, // Optional: Import your IDL JSON
  instructions: {
    // Define instruction-specific configurations
    YourInstruction: {
      summary: YourInstructionSummary, // Optional: React component for custom display summary
      tags: {
        label: 'Your Action',
        color: 'blue', // Tag color: blue, green, purple, etc.
        variant: 'subtle', // Tag style: default, outline, or subtle
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Components of the Registry

#### 1. **IDLs (Interface Definition Language)**

IDLs enable proper decoding of instruction data and accounts. Import your program's IDL JSON file and include it in the registration:

```typescript
import yourProgramIdl from './lib/idls/your-program.json';

registry.register({
  programId: 'YourProgramId...',
  name: 'Your Program',
  idl: yourProgramIdl,
  // ...
});
```

#### 2. **Instruction Summaries**

Create custom React components to display human-readable summaries of specific instructions:

```typescript
// Create a summary component in src/components/instructions/summaries/
export const YourInstructionSummary: React.FC<InstructionSummaryProps> = ({ instruction, connection }) => {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-2 text-sm">
      <div className="font-semibold">Your Action Summary</div>
      {/* Display relevant instruction data */}
    </div>
  );
};

// Register it in src/registry.ts
instructions: {
  YourInstruction: {
    summary: YourInstructionSummary,
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Transaction Tags**

Tags provide visual indicators for transaction types. They appear in the transaction table and details page:

```typescript
instructions: {
  Transfer: {
    tags: { label: 'Token Transfer', color: 'purple', variant: 'subtle' }
  },
  Swap: {
    tags: { label: 'Swap', color: 'green', variant: 'subtle' }
  }
}
```

You can also set default tags for all instructions in a program:

```typescript
registry.register({
  programId: 'YourDeFiProgram...',
  name: 'Your DeFi Protocol',
  defaultTags: { label: 'DeFi', color: 'blue', variant: 'subtle' },
  // ...
});
```

### File Structure

- `src/registry.ts` - Main registry file with all program registrations
- `src/lib/registry/` - Core registry implementation
- `src/lib/idls/` - IDL JSON files for various programs
- `src/components/instructions/summaries/` - Custom instruction summary components
- `src/lib/instructions/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for the registry system
